# TraceSharp

**TraceSharp** is a lightweight, real-time .NET console profiler that uses ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) to monitor CPU usage and managed memory allocations for a given process. Inspired by PerfView, this tool helps developers track resource consumption by method and type, ideal for debugging memory leaks or performance bottlenecks.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Monitor CPU usage using Windows Performance Counters
- ‚úÖ Track .NET GC allocations in real-time using ETW
- ‚úÖ Display heap size statistics (Gen0, Gen1, Gen2, LOH)
- ‚úÖ Periodically report top memory-consuming .NET object types
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown on `Ctrl+C` with real-time insights

## üñ•Ô∏è Example
